## Credits
Code expanded from a short comment on the [MacWorld forum] (http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20030115080027106) in 2003 by Clark Goble (https://twitter.com/clarkgoble?lang=en). Coincidentally, the author and Mr. Goble debated post-structuralism on yahoo groups fifteen-years prior to utilising Mr. Goble’s comment for the creation of this script. In remembrance of Clark Goble.
